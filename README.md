# TRYHARD GTA Macros

GTA Macros for TRYHARD players using AutoHotkey v2.

# FAQ

### Is it detected?

> I have not been banned while using this since I started developing it.

### Does it work in Full Screen?

> Yes, it works with all screen modes, including Full Screen.

### "Drop BST" is not working

> Ensure you are in a CEO Organization.
>
> There is a known bug in GTA:O where "Drop Bull Shark" says "You have hit the drop limit for this item."

### "Reload All Weapons" is not working

> There is a known bug in GTA:O where "Full Ammo" says "You are unable to purchase ammo at this time."

### "Reload All Weapons" / "Thermal Vision" sometimes fails

> If you are NOT in a CEO/MC, there is a known bug in GTA:O where "Register as a Boss" may sometimes randomly be hidden from the Interaction Menu.
> I highly recommend using the "Reload All Weapons" macro ONLY when you're in a CEO/MC, as using it outside may change your character's appearance and result in being disconnected from the session.

### Macros are not working consistently

> Try selecting a slower "Macro Speed".
>
> Your computer's specs or a generally slow session might be affecting the macro's consistency.

### Can we use Hotkey Combinations?

> Yes, you can! For more information, refer to the [AutoHotkey Modifier Keys](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/KeyList.htm#modifier).
>
> For example, the combination `CTRL+F1` corresponds to `<^F1`

# Known Bug (unlikely to be fixed)

- The macro does not consistently stop when the following keys are <ins>**quickly**</ins> pressed: \["LButton", "RButton", "Enter", "Escape", "Backspace"\]. While this currently randomely works, the implementation is not optimized. I recommend holding any of these keys down for a full second for it to works every time.

# TODO

- Load/Save `Settings.ini` file
- Add each of the following macros:
  - Anti-Kick
  - Spam Clipboard
  - Spam Rocket
  - Spam Sniper
  - Spam Pistol
