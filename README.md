# TRYHARD GTA Macros

GTA Macros for TRYHARD players using AutoHotkey v2.

# Known Bug

- I've noticed that the script won't work if the "Rockstar Games Launcher" is open. Simply close it, and everything should work fine.
- Occasionally, "Drop BST" may navigate to another menu instead of executing as expected. If this happens, try again or consider lowering the "Macro Speed" setting.
