# Known Bug

- I've noticed once that the script wonldn't work if the "Rockstar Games Launcher" window was opened. Try closing it, and everything should work fine.

- The macro does not consistently stop when the following keys are <ins>**quickly**</ins> pressed: \["LButton", "RButton", "Enter", "Escape", "Backspace"\]. While this currently randomely works, the implementation is not optimized. I recommend holding any of these keys down for a full second for it to works every time.

# Known Bugs (sorted by likelihood of fixing)

- After restarting the game, the script ain't working anymore.

- Pressing Enter in edit fields should trigger the corresponding "Apply" button, instead of triggering the "Help / Check For Updates" button.


# TODO (sorted by likelihood of completion)

- Add an anti-kick macro.

- Add an ultimate "All Settings" advanced config menu.
