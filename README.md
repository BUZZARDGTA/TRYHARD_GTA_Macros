# TRYHARD GTA Macros

GTA Macros for TRYHARD players using AutoHotkey v2.

# Known Bugs (sorted by likelihood of fixing)

- After restarting the game, the script ain't working anymore.

- Enable the taskbar icon to re-display the GUI when double-clicked and add an "Open" item on it's right clic menu.

- Pressing Enter in edit fields should trigger the corresponding "Apply" button, instead of launching the "Check for Updates" function.

- Pressing F1 and then F2 in quick succession should queue the macros in memory, rather than behaving unpredictably.

- I've noticed once that the script wonldn't work if the "Rockstar Games Launcher" window was opened. Try closing it, and everything should work fine.
