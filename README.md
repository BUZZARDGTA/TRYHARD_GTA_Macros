# Known Bug (unlikely to be fixed)

- The macro does not consistently stop when the following keys are <ins>**quickly**</ins> pressed: \["LButton", "RButton", "Enter", "Escape", "Backspace"\]. While this currently randomely works, the implementation is not optimized. I recommend holding any of these keys down for a full second for it to works every time.

# TODO

- Add the alternative way of "Reload All Weapons" by holding a specific weapon type, press Enter and THEN reloading.
- Load/Save `Settings.ini` file
- Add each of the following macros:
  - Anti-Kick
  - Toggle Thermal Vision
  - Spam Clipboard
  - Spam Rocket
  - Spam Sniper
  - Spam Pistol
