# TRYHARD GTA Macros

GTA Macros for TRYHARD players using AutoHotkey v2.

# Known Bug

- I've noticed once that the script wonldn't work if the "Rockstar Games Launcher" window was opened. Try closing it, and everything should work fine.
- A visual glitch occurs on the Macro Buttons at startup. Moving your cursor over the glitch will fix it temporarily.
